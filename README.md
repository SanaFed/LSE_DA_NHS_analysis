# LSE_DA_NHS_analysis
Diagnostic Analysis of the NHS data related to general practitioner (GP) appointments.

The National Health Services (NHS), a publicly funded healthcare system in England, incurs significant costs when patients miss general practitioner (GP) appointments. 

This data analytics project aims to help NHS reduce or eliminate missed appointments by identifying:
a)	possible appointment-related trends associated with locations, service settings, context types, national categories, and appointment statuses; 
b)	possible appointment-related trends connected to time series/seasons; 
c)	the top trending hashtags (#) on Twitter related to healthcare in the UK;
d)	if there is adequate staff and capacity in the networks, and what was the actual utilisation of resources.
